## A repository of TiddlyWikis

Here I have a web of tiddlywikis (www.tiddlywiki.com), which can be explored either to find content about my work, life and tasks, or as a meta-exploration of the tiddly structure. To see information and examples of what can be done, see the wiki at murnanedaniel.github.io/MyWiki/wiki/.
